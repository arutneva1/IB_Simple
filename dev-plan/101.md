# 101 — Kid‑Friendly Testing & Acceptance Guide (Windows + Anaconda)

Hi! This guide shows **exactly** how to test and accept each phase of the IBKR ETF Rebalancer project. It’s written for a smart 12‑year‑old using **Windows** and **Anaconda**. Follow the steps in order. If something looks scary, don’t worry—just do it step by step.

---

## 0) One‑Time Setup (do this once)

### 0.1 Install Anaconda (if you don’t have it)
- Download and install **Anaconda** for Windows (just click “Next” until it finishes).

### 0.2 Make a project folder
- Put the unzipped **ibkr-rebalancer** folder somewhere easy, like `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\`.

### 0.3 Open **Anaconda Prompt**
- Press the Windows key, type **Anaconda Prompt**, and open it.

### 0.4 Create and activate your Python environment
```bat
conda create -n ibkr-rebal python=3.10 -y
conda activate ibkr-rebal
```
You should see `(ibkr-rebal)` at the beginning of the line now.

### 0.5 Go into the project
```bat
cd path\to\ibkr-rebalancer
```
Example:
```bat
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\ibkr-rebalancer
```

### 0.6 Install the tools
```bat
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```
If you see warnings, that’s okay. If you see big red **ERROR** lines, tell an adult or check the Troubleshooting section at the bottom.

## How to Test & Accept a Phase
For each phase below, you’ll do three things:
1) **Run the exact commands** shown.  
2) **Check what happens** and compare with the “What success looks like” box.  
3) If it matches, **check the box** for that phase. ✅

> Tip: If a command says `path\to\...`, replace it with your real path.

---

## Milestone A — Foundations

### Phase A1 — Repo scaffold & local environment
**Goal:** The project opens, tools install, and a tiny test passes.

**Do this:**
```bat
conda activate ibkr-rebal
cd path\to\ibkr-rebalancer
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest -q -m "not integration"
```

**What success looks like:**
- Pre‑commit finishes with no errors (maybe some files got auto‑fixed—that’s OK).  
- `pytest` prints something like `1 passed`.

**Accept A1**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase A2 — CI pipeline & quality gates
**Goal:** The project has a robot checker (CI) set up for GitHub.

**Do this:**
1) If you use GitHub, push the project (ask an adult if you’re new to Git).
2) On GitHub, open the repo → **Actions** tab. Make sure the **CI** workflow runs.

**What success looks like:**
- The CI job has a green checkmark. (Yellow means “running”; red means “failed”.)

**Accept A2**: ☐ Passed

---

## Milestone B — Inputs, Validation, & State

### Phase B1 — Config loader & checks
**Goal:** The app reads `config/settings.ini` and says if it’s OK.

**Do this (temporary placeholder test):**
```bat
python - <<"PY"
from src.io import config_loader
print("(placeholder) pretend we validated config")
PY
```
> When the real code exists, the command might be:
> ```bat
> python -m src.io.config_loader config\settings.ini
> ```

**What success looks like:**
- You see a simple “OK”/message without errors (for placeholder, any output without errors is fine).  
- Later, bad configs should show clear error messages.

**Accept B1**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase B2 — CSV parser & portfolio checks
**Goal:** The app reads `data/portfolios.csv` and checks for mistakes.

**Do this (temporary placeholder test):**
```bat
python - <<"PY"
from pathlib import Path
p = Path("data/portfolios.csv")
print("CSV exists:", p.exists())
print("First 3 lines:")
print("\n".join(p.read_text().splitlines()[:3]))
PY
```
> When the real code exists, the command might be:
> ```bat
> python -m src.io.portfolio_csv data\portfolios.csv
> ```

**What success looks like:**
- File exists and prints the first lines.  
- Later, the real validator prints “OK” for good CSV or a **clear error** for broken CSV.

**Accept B2**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase B3 — IBKR connection & snapshot (paper)
**Goal:** The app connects to the paper IBKR account and shows your positions.

**Before you start:**
- Open **IBKR TWS** or **IB Gateway** and log in to **paper trading**.  
- In TWS Settings → **API**: Enable socket clients. Note the **port** (usually 4002).
- Edit `config/settings.ini` → put your **account_id** and correct **port**.

**Do this (placeholder):**
```bat
python - <<"PY"
print("(placeholder) pretend we connected to IBKR and fetched positions")
PY
```
> When the real code exists, the command might be:
> ```bat
> python -m src.broker.ibkr_client --snapshot --config config\settings.ini
> ```

**What success looks like:**
- Later, you’ll see a small JSON‑like list of positions and cash. For now, any output without a red error is okay.

**Accept B3**: ☐ Passed

---

## Milestone C — Core Logic & Preview

### Phase C1 — Model mixing & target builder
**Goal:** Mix the 3 models using their weights to make **final targets**.

**Do this (placeholder):**
```bat
python - <<"PY"
from src.core import targets
print("(placeholder) final targets would be shown here")
PY
```
> Later, expect a neat table like: `SPY 25.0%`, `IAU 7.0%`, ... and totals ≈ 100%.

**What success looks like:**
- A table/list of target percentages that add up to about 100%.

**Accept C1**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase C2 — Drift, triggers & prioritization
**Goal:** Compare what you **own now** vs **targets**; show **drift** in **%** and **$**.

**Do this (placeholder):**
```bat
python - <<"PY"
from src.core import drift
print("(placeholder) drift % and $ would appear here")
PY
```
> Later, expect rows like: `SPY drift +1.9% ($1900)` and which ones should be traded.

**What success looks like:**
- A list of which symbols drifted and which ones need trading (based on rules).

**Accept C2**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase C3 — Sizing, leverage guard, rounding, cash buffer
**Goal:** Turn the drifts into **share quantities** we should buy/sell safely.

**Do this (placeholder):**
```bat
python - <<"PY"
from src.core import sizing
print("(placeholder) share sizes with leverage checks would be here")
PY
```
> Later, expect whole‑share numbers (unless fractional is allowed) and a note that leverage stays under the max.

**What success looks like:**
- You see numbers of shares to trade. Leverage is safe. Tiny trades are skipped.

**Accept C3**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase C4 — Preview & CLI confirmation
**Goal:** Show a full **trade plan** and ask **“Proceed? [y/N]”**.

**Do this (works now as a placeholder):**
```bat
python src\rebalance.py --dry-run --config config\settings.ini --csv data\portfolios.csv
```

**What success looks like:**
- You see a “Preview would be generated here” message (placeholder).  
- In the real version, you’ll see a table and a batch summary (how much to buy/sell). No orders go to IBKR in **dry run**.

**Accept C4**: ☐ Passed

---

## Milestone D — Execution & Reporting

### Phase D1 — Order submission (paper)
**Goal:** After you press **Y**, the app sends **market orders** (adaptive/midprice if possible; else plain market).

**Do this (placeholder today):**
```bat
python src\rebalance.py --confirm --config config\settings.ini --csv data\portfolios.csv
```
When it asks `Proceed? [y/N]:` type **y** and hit **Enter**.

**What success looks like:**
- Today: messages saying “Submitting batch...” and “Done” (placeholder).  
- Real app: orders go to your **paper** account and finish.

**Accept D1**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase D2 — Reporting & logging
**Goal:** Save a **CSV report** for each run in the `reports/` folder.

**Do this:**
- After running D1, look in the `reports/` folder.

**What success looks like:**
- Today: the placeholder prints say a report would be written.  
- Real app: a **timestamped CSV** appears with columns like: symbol, target %, current %, drift %/$, action, qty, status, etc.

**Accept D2**: ☐ Passed

---

## Milestone E — Hardening & Release

### Phase E1 — Resilience & polish
**Goal:** Fewer weird crashes and nicer messages.

**Do this:**
- Try running commands when TWS is **closed** (should show a friendly message).  
- Try a broken CSV (should **abort** with a clear explanation).  
- Press **Ctrl+C** during a run (should stop cleanly).

**What success looks like:**
- The app explains what went wrong and how to fix it. No messy crashes.

**Accept E1**: ☐ Passed

---

### Phase E2 — Docs & handoff
**Goal:** Anyone can follow the docs and succeed.

**Do this:**
- Give the repo to a friend. Ask them to follow **README + this 101 guide**.  
- They should reach **dry‑run** and then a tiny **paper trade**.

**What success looks like:**
- Your friend succeeds without needing secret tips from you.

**Accept E2**: ☐ Passed

---

## Troubleshooting (friendly tips)
- **Command not found?** Make sure the **Anaconda Prompt** is open and the env is active: `conda activate ibkr-rebal`.
- **Permission error?** Close any programs using the files and try again.
- **TWS/Gateway connection fails?** Open TWS (paper) → Settings → API enabled; correct **port** (usually 4002). Update `config/settings.ini`.
- **Pip failed?** Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` and try `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.
- **Weird Windows path?** Use quotes: `cd "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\ibkr-rebalancer"`.
