# followups.md â€” Doc review notes

- Cross-checked `dev-plan/101.md` against `checklist.md`, `plan.md`, and `srs.md`.
- Updated commands to `validate_portfolios` and `snapshot` for consistency.
- Expanded success boxes to mention CSV validation, drift checks, leverage guards, and report columns.
- `workflow.md` now lists `pre-commit run --all-files` in Daily Driver Commands.
- Future: once real modules output data, refresh examples and verify command names remain accurate.
